  Combined robot hw kinetic

  This will make it possible to combine several RobotHW objects into a single one.
* 0.10.1
* Update changelogs
* Fix rosconsole errors from test build
* 0.10.0
* Update changelogs
* Merge pull request #210 from ros-controls/fix-do-switch-jade
  controller_manager: Fix doSwitch execution point - jade
* controller_manager: Fix doSwitch execution point
  The doSwitch method needs to be executed in the update() method,  that is, in
  the real-time path, which is where controller switching actually takes place.
  It was previously done in the switchController callback, which is non real-time.
  In this method controller switching is scheduled, but not actually executed.
  This changeset fixes a bug in which hardware interface  modes could switch
  before controllers, leading to undefined behavior.
* Merge pull request #218 from ros-controls/prepare-switch-jade
  Prepare switch jade
* Deprecate RobotHW::canSwitch
  Has been superceeded by RobotHW::prepareSwitch.
* Cosmetic: Wrap method args across multiple lines
* Introduce prepareSwitch, replacement of canSwitch
  RobotHW::prepareSwitch is intended as a substitute for RobotHW::canSwitch.
  The main reasons for the change are a non-const signature to allow
  changing state and a more descriptive name.
  RobotHW::canSwitch will be deprecated in a later ROS distro.
* Merge pull request #204 from ros-controls/multi-iface-ctrl
  Allow controllers to claim resources from multiple interfaces
* hardware_interface: Add InterfaceManager::getNames
  Add new method that allows to query the names of all interfaces managed by
  an InterfaceManager instance.
* hardware_interface: Multi-interface controllers
  - This is a C++ API breaking changeset.
  - Modify ControllerInfo class to allow controllers to claim resources from
  multiple hardware interfaces.
  - Propagate changes to RobotHW::checkForConflict: Default resource ownsership
  policy is aware of controllers claiming resources from  multiple hardware
  interfaces.
  - Update and extend the corresponding test suite.

0.4.0 (2013-06-25)
------------------
* Version 0.4.0
* 1.0.1
* Merge pull request #66 from pal-robotics/master
  Fix duplicate header guard + minor maintenance.
* Add another convenience symbol demangling method.
  We already had:
  string foo_name = demangledTypeName<FooType>();
  which works great for typenames, but we were missing the equivalent for specific
  instances:
  FooType foo;
  string foo_name = demangledTypeName(foo);
  ...which works well for polymorphic types, returning the derived-most name.
* Fix duplicate header guard.
* Merge branch 'master' of github.com:willowgarage/ros_control
* Merge pull request #63 from pal-robotics/master
  Fix package URLs in package.xml
* Fix package URL in package.xml
* Merge pull request #62 from pal-robotics/master
  Update Doxygen doc, fix compiler warning.
* Fix compiler warning (-Wreorder).
* Merge pull request #59 from pal-robotics/master
  Documentation and log message improvements
* Restore documentation of handle parameters.
  Documentation that was previously in the interface classes before the
  hardware interface rework has been moved to the handle classes.
* Merge branch 'hardware_interface_rework'
* Fix ResourceManager exception messages.
  - Print derived class name instead of the less descriptive and more cryptic
  base class name. Eg.
  "hardware_interface::JointCommandInterface"
  instead of
  "hardware_interface::ResourceManager<hardware_interface::JointStateHandle>"
* Trivial doc/whitespace fix.
* Merge pull request #54 from pal-robotics/hardware_interface_rework
  Hardware interface rework
* Merge branch 'master' into hardware_interface_rework
  Conflicts:
  hardware_interface/CMakeLists.txt
* Separate resource manager in two classes.
  - Refs #45.
  - HardwareInterface specifics (ie. resource claiming) has been factored out.
  We now have the non-polymorphic ResourceManager class for registering and
  getting handles, and the polymorphic HardwareResourceManager that
  additionally implements the HardwareInterface and takes care of resource
  claiming.
  - The above change is required if the transmission interface is to leverage
  the resource management code, but without the hardware interface specifics.
  - Move files back to the internal folder. They are building blocks of the
  public API of hardware interfaces, but should not be directly #included
  by end users, so it's best they don't share the same location as
  user-facing headers.
  - Update unit tests.
* Add missing include statement.
* Validate raw data wrapped by hardware interfaces.
  - Refs #47 and #52.
  - Initialize raw data pointers to 0 in default handle constructors, otherwise
  they evaluate to nonzero and there is no way to distinguish an uninitialized
  state (ie. dangling pointers) from a properly initialized one.
  - For non-empty handle constructors, validate input raw data, throw if invalid
  pointers are found.
  - Add assertions on handle accessors. Invalid reads will trigger the assertions
  instead of causing a segfault (in debug mode).
  - Update unit tests.
* Warn when replacing a handle/interface.
  It is legitimate to change the underlying data associated to a handle/interface
  name, but it might also be a common programming error. Having the logs reflect
  this situation would allow to spot it easily.
* Make error message more explicit in test.
  Output with ROS_ERROR_STREAM instead of std::cout
* Add RobotHW class test.
* Add virtual destructor, protected internals.
  - ResourceManager inherits from HardwareInterface, which has virtual methods,
  so a virtual destructor is required.
  - Internal members are protected instead of private.
* Unit test hardware_interfaces.
* More uniform hardware_interface API. Refs  #45.
* Merge pull request #51 from jhu-lcsr-forks/master
  Adding cmake install targets
* adding install targets
* Merge pull request #49 from pal-robotics/master
  Restore joint resource claiming!.
* Restore joint resource claiming!.
  It had been mistakenly removed in a previous commit.
* Merge pull request #40 from jhu-lcsr-forks/catkin
  catkinizing, could still be cleaned up
* merging CMakeLists.txt files from rosbuild and catkin
* adding hybrid-buildsystem makefiles
* Merging from master, re-adding manifest.xml files
* Merge pull request #46 from pal-robotics/master
  Fix package URLs in manifest
* Fix package URLs.
* Merge pull request #44 from pal-robotics/master

* Fix exception throwing.

  Harmonize how variables are quoted in log statements. Fixes #42.
* Harmonize how variables are quoted in logs.
  - Unify to using 'single quotes'.
  - Fixes #42.
* Merge pull request #41 from pal-robotics/master
  Add explicit actuators interface, create internal folder/namespace for non-public API
* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/willowgarage/ros_control
  Conflicts:
  hardware_interface/include/hardware_interface/joint_command_interface.h
* Add explicit actuator hardware interfaces.
  - These classes are similar to the existing joint equivalents, and are useful
  in setups leveraging the transmission_interface.
* Refactor named resource management code.
  - In preparation for the explicitly typed actuators interface, code for managing
  named resources has been refactored into a separate class. This code consists
  of convenience methods wrapping a std::map container, and occur often enough
  that factoring it out to prevent duplication makes sense.
  - Code that is not part of the public API, and hence with no stability guarantees
  has been moved to the internal folder/namespace. It only affects the named
  resource management and symbol demanglind methods so far.
* catkinizing, could still be cleaned up
* add accessor for command
* Remove redundant semicolons.
* Merge pull request #37 from pal-robotics/master
  Issue #36 fix.
* Use demangled type names when available. Fixes #36.
  Type names are used in different interfaces  such as hardware_interface and
  controller_interface. When symbol demangling is available (currently gcc 3.0+),
  operate on demangled names, as they are more convenient for human reading, eg.
  hardware_interface::VelocityJointInterface
  instead of
  N18hardware_interface22VelocityJointInterfaceE
