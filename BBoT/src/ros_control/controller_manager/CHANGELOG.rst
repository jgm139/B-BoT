* Merge pull request #210 from ros-controls/fix-do-switch-jade
  controller_manager: Fix doSwitch execution point - jade
* controller_manager: Fix doSwitch execution point
  The doSwitch method needs to be executed in the update() method,  that is, in
  the real-time path, which is where controller switching actually takes place.
  It was previously done in the switchController callback, which is non real-time.
  In this method controller switching is scheduled, but not actually executed.
  This changeset fixes a bug in which hardware interface  modes could switch
  before controllers, leading to undefined behavior.
* Merge pull request #218 from ros-controls/prepare-switch-jade
  Prepare switch jade
* Deprecate RobotHW::canSwitch
  Has been superceeded by RobotHW::prepareSwitch.
* Introduce prepareSwitch, replacement of canSwitch
  RobotHW::prepareSwitch is intended as a substitute for RobotHW::canSwitch.
  The main reasons for the change are a non-const signature to allow
  changing state and a more descriptive name.
  RobotHW::canSwitch will be deprecated in a later ROS distro.
* Merge pull request #204 from ros-controls/multi-iface-ctrl
  Allow controllers to claim resources from multiple interfaces
* controller_manager: Multi-interface controllers
  - This is a C++ API breaking changeset.
  - Make controller_manager aware of controllers that claim resources from more
  than one hardware interface.
  - Update and extend the corresponding test suite.
* Merge pull request #205 from ros-controls/w-unused-parameter
  Address -Wunused-parameter warnings
* Address -Wunused-parameter warnings

  Fixes for next minor release
* Extended wait time to 30 seconds for slower computers
* Renamed manifest.xml to prevent conflicts with rosdep
* Fix broken unspawner script.
* Check controller_manager API early. Fast shutdown.
  - Check for all services required by spawner at the beginning, so it can know
  early on that it has all its requisites.
  - Remove service waiting from shutdown to ensure a fast teardown.
  Usecase: A spawner that dies after the controller manager should not wait
  for services to appear as they will never appear, the controllers are already
  stopped. This happens for example when killing a Gazebo session.
* Restore controller stop+unload on node kill.
  - Fixes #111.

0.5.7 (2013-07-30)
------------------
* Updated changelogs
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of github.com:ros-controls/ros_control into hydro-devel
* Merge pull request #107 from kphawkins/hydro-devel
  Fix controller_manager.cpp reload-libraries/getControllerNames not clearing names first
* Update controller_manager.cpp
  getControllerNames now clears names before adding current names.  This fixes a bug in reloadControllerLibrariesSrv where the method is called twice in a row without first clearing the list.
  Steps to reproduce:
  - Spawn controller
  - Stop controller
  - reload-libraries
  controller_manager.cpp:501: bool controller_manager::ControllerManager::reloadControllerLibrariesSrv(controller_manager_msgs::ReloadControllerLibraries::Request&, controller_manager_msgs::ReloadControllerLibraries::Response&): Assertion `controllers.empty()' failed.
