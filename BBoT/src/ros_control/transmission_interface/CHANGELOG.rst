  mechanical reduction on the joint output. This is especially convenient for
  flipping the rotation direction of a joint (negative reduction value).

  by the robot hardware abstraction. The rest are plain members whose lifetime
  is bound to the loader struct.
* Trivial test addition.
* Remove unnecessary header dependencies.
* Catkin fixes.
* Fix bug when adding multiple transmissions.
  - std::vectors were being used to store raw joint data, and when new transmissions

  Add transmission interface
* Merge branch 'transmission_interface' of https://github.com/pal-robotics/ros_control into transmission_interface
* Add additional minimal example to mainpage doc.
  Existing example was complete, but quite long. It's better to start with a
  small and simple example.
* Update README.md
  Add additional minimal example.
* Update package wiki URL.
* Update README.md
* Update README.md
* Trivial doc fix.
* Add main page to documentation.
  It includes an overview of the transmission_interface package, pointers to the
  more relevant classes, and a commented example.
* Make transmission interface more general.
  The previous API assumed that to map a variable like position, one only
  needed actuator and joint space position variables. Although this is often the
  case (eg. fully actuated/determined transmissions), this does not hold in
  general. Underactuated transmissions are a typical example of this.
  Now each map accepts full <position,velocity,effort> triplets for actuator and
  joint space variables, and uses only the ones it needs.
  Although the current API has gained in generality, it has lost some of the
  explicitness it had before. For instance, if only position variables are
  needed for a map, one still needs to pass the full triplet (velocity and
  effort variables can be empty).
  Finally, unit tests and documentation have been updated to reflect the changes.
* Merge branch 'transmission_interface' of https://github.com/pal-robotics/ros_control into transmission_interface
* Minor documentation building fixes.
  - Remove test folder from docs.
  - Add proper export element in manifest.
* Update transmission_interface/README.md
* Update transmission_interface/README.md
* Add readme file.
* Remove pure virtual method.
* Use \name commands in documentation.
* Add pthread dependency to tests.
  After moving from Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04 these dependencies need to be explicitly
  stated in my dev machine. This should be looked upon in greater detail, as such
  dependecies should be taken care of by rosbuild.
* Remove dependency from manifest.
* Add transmission interface class and test.
* Add transmission accessors test.
* Remove unnecessary virtual keywords.
* Add credit statement in docs.
* Add comprehensive doc to implemented transmissions.
  - More desriptive overview.
  - Images depicting each transmission type. Binary pngs  are under version control
  instead of getting auto-generated in the Makefile as not all build environments
  may have the necessary svg->png filters.
  - Expressions governing transmissions in tabular form.
* Basic documentation for implemented transmissions.
* Document abstract Transmission class.
* Add basic support for mechanical transmissions.
  - Base transmission class with abstract interface.
  - Specializations for three common transmission types: simple, differential and
  four-bar-linkage.
  - Unit tests with exercising preconditions, black-box and white-box tests.
