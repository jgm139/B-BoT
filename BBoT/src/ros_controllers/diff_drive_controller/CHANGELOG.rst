* Contributors: Adolfo Rodriguez Tsouroukdissian, Enrique Fernandez, Paul Mathieu

0.9.2 (2015-05-04)
------------------
* Update changelogs.
* Merge pull request #169 from bmagyar/separation_and_diameter_params
  [diff_drive_controller] Add wheel_separation and wheel_radius parameters
* remove diff_drive_bad_urdf.test
  The 'bad' URDF is not that bad any more since the wheel radius can be set via parameter for non-cylindrical wheels.
  However, it used outdated joint names that would cause controller creation to fail even with the wheel_radius parameter set.
  Since diff_drive_wrong.test already checks that case, and diff_drive_radius_param_fail.test explicitly checks for behavior with missing wheel_radius, diff_drive_bad_urdf.test is obsolete
* style and whitespace fixes
* move short-circuit of URDF lookup into setOdomParamsFromUrdf
* add test for wheel_separation parameter
  this doesn't technically test whether the separation is set correctly, but observing the controller's info output shows that it is
* add test that checks wheel_radius parameter functionality
* add test that checks that controller initialization fails when wheels are not cylinders and no wheel_radius parameter is given
* add a sphere-wheeled version of diffbot to test the new wheel_radius parameter
* allow the wheel separation and radius to be set from different sources
  i.e. one can be set from the URDF, the other from a parameter
* If wheel separation and wheel diameter is specified, don't look them up from urdf

  addressing test dependencies with -DCATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING=0
* diff_drive_controller: add realtime_tools dependency
  When executing 'catkin_make -DCATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING=0', this error occurs:
  In file included from [...]/diff_drive_controller/src/diff_drive_controller.cpp:45:0:
  [...]/diff_drive_controller/include/diff_drive_controller/diff_drive_controller.h:46:44: fatal error: realtime_tools/realtime_buffer.h: No such file or directory
  #include <realtime_tools/realtime_buffer.h>
  ^
  compilation terminated.
  make[2]: *** [ros_controllers/diff_drive_controller/CMakeFiles/diff_drive_controller.dir/src/diff_drive_controller.cpp.o] Error 1
  Obviously, the realtime_tools dependency was missing in the CMakeLists.txt file.

0.8.1 (2014-07-11)
------------------
* Update chegelogs
* Contributors: Adolfo Rodriguez Tsouroukdissian

0.8.0 (2014-05-12)
------------------
* Updated changelogs
* Add base_frame_id param (defaults to base_link)
  The nav_msgs/Odometry message specifies the child_frame_id field,
  which was previously not set.
  This commit creates a parameter to replace the previously hard-coded
  value of the child_frame_id of the published tf frame, and uses it
  in the odom message as well.
* Contributors: Dave Coleman, enriquefernandez

0.7.2 (2014-04-01)
------------------
* Prepare 0.7.2
* Contributors: Adolfo Rodriguez Tsouroukdissian

0.7.1 (2014-03-31)
------------------

* diff_drive: bump version to 0.6.0
  To match the rest of `ros_controllers`
* Merge pull request #77 from pal-robotics/diff-drive-controller
  Controller for differential drive wheel base
* Added documentation about assumptions + comment aesthetics
* diff_drive: add unit test for bad urdf
  This unit test exercises a controller load failure caused by
  a wrong wheel geometry. The controller requires that wheels be
  modeled by cylinders, while the bad URDF uses spheres.
* diff_drive: add test for controller load failure
  This test exercises a controller load failure due to a misnamed
  wheel link name in the controller configuration file.
* diff_drive: use backslashes in doxygen documentation
* diff_drive: fix indentation of diffbot.xacro
* diff_drive: refactor integrate* methods in odometry
  refs #30
* diff_drive: resize the TF odom publisher at init
  This is to avoid push_back mem allocations inside of the real-time loop
* diff_drive: set version to 0.5.4
* diff_drive: add install rule for the plugin xml
* adds angular velocity/acceleration limits tests
* fixes default min velocity/acceleration params
* diff_drive: fix comments
* diff_drive: add unit test for parameter multipliers
* diff_drive: fix dependencies
  Too few in CMakeLists.txt, too many in package.xml
* diff_drive: fix nasty crash on some platforms (OSX)
  This one is nasty. Because we _manually\_ load the controller at runtime,
  we have to build it with special flags to export the run-time type
  information (rtti) needed for stuff like dynamic_cast. But we don't, and
  here it's simpler to just use a static_cast.
  See here: http://gcc.gnu.org/faq.html#dso
  A dynamic_cast without a check is stupid anyway. (_what could possibly
  go wrong?..._)
* diff_drive: change the limiter policy to open-loop
  Also prevent a potential problem with uninitialized command structure
* diff_drive: use wheel separation and radius multipliers for the odometry
* diff_drive: add unit test for cmd_vel_timeout
* diff_drive: update unit tests
* diff_drive: rename cmd_vel_old_threshold to cmd_vel_timeout
  The default is now 0.5s instead of 1.0s
