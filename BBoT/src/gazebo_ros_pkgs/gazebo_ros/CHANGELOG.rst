  $(grep -rlI GetWorldPose gazebo\_* | grep -v vacuum)
  ~~~
  * remove ifdefs for commented GetWorldPose
* Prevents GAZEBO_MODEL_DATABASE_URI from being overwritten (#644)
* Fix gazebo8 warnings part 7: ifdef's for Joint::GetAngle and some cleanup (#642)

* Contributors: Hilario Tome, R, Steven Peters

2.5.14 (2017-12-11)
-------------------
* Fix latin character not allowed failing by prepare_release script
* Generate changelogs
* for gazebo8+, call functions without Get (#639)
* Fix gazebo8 warnings part 5: ignition math in gazebo_ros (#635)
  * gazebo_ros: ign-math in private API, local vars
  * gazebo_ros: pass const reference instead of copy
* Fix gazebo8 warnings part 4: convert remaining local variables in plugins to ign-math (#633)
  * plugins: convert all local vars to ign-math

  * Use World::[GS]etGravity
  * fix gravity syntax
* gazebo_ros: fix support for python3 (#622)
* gazebo_ros_api_plugin: improve plugin xml parsing (#625)
  An xml comment that start with plugin causes a seg-fault:
  <!--plugin-->
  or
  <!--plugin filename="lib.so"/-->
  This fixes the xml parsing to not try to add child elements
  to xml comments.
* Replace Events::Disconnect* with pointer reset (#623)
* Install spawn_model using catkin_install_python (#621)
* [gazebo_ros] don't overwrite parameter "use_sim_time" (#606)
  * Parameter /use_sim_time is only set if not present on Parameter Server
* Contributors: Jose Luis Rivero, Manuel Ilg, Mike Purvis, Nils Rokita, Steven Peters

2.5.13 (2017-06-24)
-------------------
* Update changelogs
* Quote arguments to echo in libcommon.sh (#590)
  If /bin/sh is provided by bash, echo will consume arguments such as `-e`. On such a system, running `rosrun gazebo_ros gzserver -e ode empty_world.world` will execute `gzserver` with the `-e` missing (meaning the world file is ignored).
* Add catkin package(s) to provide the default version of Gazebo - take II (kinetic-devel) (#571)
  * Added catkin package gazebo_dev which provides the cmake config of the installed Gazebo version
  Conflicts:
  gazebo_plugins/package.xml
  gazebo_ros/package.xml
  gazebo_ros_control/package.xml
  * gazebo_plugins/gazebo_ros: removed dependency SDF from CMakeLists.txt
  The sdformat library is an indirect dependency of Gazebo and does not need to be linked explicitly.
  * gazebo_dev: added execution dependency gazebo

2.5.8 (2016-12-06)
------------------
* Update changelogs for 2.5.8
* Merge pull request #516 from ros-simulation/reorder_parameters
  Workaround to support gazebo and ROS arguments in the command line respecting ROS remappings.
* Use -q with grep and fix comments. Thanks to Martin Pecka.
* Workaround to support gazebo and ROS arguments in the command line
  Reorder command line arguments to place ROS remappings at the end so
  gazebo passed them to be handle by gazebo ROS plugins. While this
  is not the recommended way of using rosrun, it could be useful for
  some use cases.
* Merge pull request #514 from jonbinney/jb-revert-remapping-removal
  Make ROS remapping to work again by reverting the change "Remove ROS remapping arguments from gazebo_ros launch scripts."
* Revert "Remove ROS remapping arguments from gazebo_ros launch scripts."
  This reverts commit a90e609a81702b13bee235b079081edf68ff6971.
* Merge pull request #501 from ros-simulation/kinetic-devel-transplant-500
  gazebo_ros: replace 'headless' arg with 'recording' (kinetic-devel)
* Merge pull request #502 from ros-simulation/kinetic-devel-transplant-495
  Fixed getLinkState service's angular Z velocity return
* Fixed getlinkstate service's angular velocity return
* Added comments regarding 'headless' arg and issue #491. Added 'recording' arg as switch for -r
* Merge pull request #467 from ros-simulation/kinetic-devel-transplant-459
  launch scripts override GAZEBO_MASTER_URI (kinetic-devel)
* GAZEBO_MASTER_URI is loaded from setup.sh if empty in environment.
* Honor GAZEBO_MASTER_URI for gzserver.
* Honor GAZEBO_MASTER_URI for gzclient.
* launch scripts override GAZEBO_MASTER_URI
  GAZEBO_MASTER_URI is always the one written in `setup.sh`, even if a different value is set in the user's environment.
  I consider it counter-intuitive, if you e.g. run `GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=http://myserver:11345 rosrun gazebo_ros gzserver`, that the server is still started with the default URI.
