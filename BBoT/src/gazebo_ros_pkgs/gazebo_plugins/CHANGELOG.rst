  to kinect_openni and prosilica sensors
* Namespace console output (#543)
  Namespace all console output
* Merge pull request #540 from ros-simulation/kinetic-devel-transplant-410
  Correct the timestamp used by the camera (kinetic-devel)
* Fix problem introduced with the merge
* Fix merge with kinetic branch
* #408 Increasing max time because some systems are taking 0.6 seconds to receive the messages (still well less than 2.0 seconds). Also all the tests can be run with run_tests_gazebo_plugins_rostest but only with the -j1 flag #409
* Fix merge with kinetic branch
* Fix merge with kinetic branch
* #408 also test points publication
* #408 Created test for depth camera, which fails, so next make it pass
* Disabling this test because of #409
* Adding depth camera world to use in test to make depth camera have right timestamp #408- appears to be working (though only looking at horizon) but getting these sdf errors:
  Error [SDF.cc:789] Missing element description for [pointCloudTopicName]
  Error [SDF.cc:789] Missing element description for [depthImageCameraInfoTopicName]
  Error [SDF.cc:789] Missing element description for [pointCloudCutoff]
* #408 Make the multi camera timestamps current rather than outdated, also reuse the same update code
* Fix merge with kinetic branch
* #408 Making a test for multicamra that shows the timestamps are currently outdated, will fix them similar to how the regular camera was fixed.
* Fix for issue #408. The last measurement time is the time that gazebo generated the sensor data, so ought to be used. updateRate doesn't seem that useful.
  The other cameras need similar fixes to have the proper timestamps.

* Fix row_step of openni_kinect plugin
* remove duplicated code during merge
* merging from indigo-devel

* Merge pull request #373 from wkentaro/openni-kinect-organized-points
  [gazebo_plugins] Publish organized point cloud from openni_kinect plugin
* gazebo_ros_utils.h: include gazebo_config.h
  Make sure to include gazebo_config.h,
  which defines the GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION macro
* Fix compiler error with SetHFOV
  In gazebo7, the rendering::Camera::SetHFOV function
  is overloaded with a potential for ambiguity,
  as reported in the following issue:
  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1830
  This fixes the build by explicitly defining the
  Angle type.
* Add missing boost header
  Some boost headers were remove from gazebo7 header files
  and gazebo_ros_joint_state_publisher.cpp was using it
  implicitly.
* Fix gazebo7 build errors
  The SensorPtr types have changed from boost:: pointers
  to std:: pointers,
  which requires boost::dynamic_pointer_cast to change to
  std::dynamic_pointer_cast.
  A helper macro is added that adds a `using` statement
  corresponding to the correct type of dynamic_pointer_cast.
  This macro should be narrowly scoped to protect
  other code.
* Merge pull request #381 from ros-simulation/gazebo7_fixes
  Gazebo7 fixes
* gazebo_ros_utils.h: include gazebo_config.h
  Make sure to include gazebo_config.h,
  which defines the GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION macro
* Use Joint::SetParam for joint velocity motors
  Before gazebo5, Joint::SetVelocity and SetMaxForce
  were used to set joint velocity motors.
  The API has changed in gazebo5, to use Joint::SetParam
  instead.
  The functionality is still available through the SetParam API.
  cherry-picked from indigo-devel
  Add ifdefs to fix build with gazebo2
  It was broken by #315.
  Fixes #321.
* Fix gazebo6 deprecation warnings
  Several RaySensor functions are deprecated in gazebo6
  and are removed in gazebo7.
  The return type is changed to use ignition math
  and the function name is changed.
  This adds ifdef's to handle the changes.
* Merge pull request #380 from ros-simulation/gazebo6_angle_deprecations
  Fix gazebo6 deprecation warnings
* Fix compiler error with SetHFOV

* Remove unneeded dependency on pcl_ros
  pcl_ros hasn't been released yet into indigo. I asked @wjwwood about
  its status, and he pointed out that our dependency on pcl_ros
  probably isn't necessary. Lo and behold, we removed it from the
  header files, package.xml and CMakeLists.txt and gazebo_plugins
  still compiles.

  commit declares several of those dependencies.
